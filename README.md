# fixcollege
Starting my Business! I hope to make FixCollege a supplement to several degrees from simple replacements of PowerPoints to a more interactive learning experience to  providing cs degrees with meaningful experience. Instead of learning about Semaphores and Registers, finally learn how to code from scratch to actually do real life stuff.
